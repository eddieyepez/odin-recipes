        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Shrimp ceviche or ceviche de camaron is one of the most popular Ecuadorian ceviches. Ceviches, also known as cebiches (both spellings are acceptable), are very popular all around Ecuador, but especially at the beach. One of the great things about this type of Ecuadorian ceviche is that the shrimp are already cooked.</p>

        <P>So if you have any health concerns or aren’t comfortable with the idea of trying to make homemade fish ceviche – which is typically raw fish “cooked” by the acidity of lime juice – then this one is perfect for you, especially if you want to try it for the first time. Of course making fish ceviche with fresh high quality sushi grade fish and keeping it refrigerated makes it safer to prepare and eat at home. Once you are comfortable with the shrimp variation I recommend that you try the fish one.</P>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds about 1 kilo, of cooked shrimp (if you buy it raw, I suggest you cook it in beer or coconut milk for amazing flavor)</li>
            <li>2 red onions sliced very thinly</li>
            <li>4 tomatoes sliced very thinly or diced</li>
            <li>1 bell pepper red or green, diced - optional</li>
            <li>10-15 limes freshly squeezed</li>
            <li>The juice of 1 orange</li>
            <li>½ cup of ketchup or ½ cup of freshly blended tomato juice for a fresher style ceviche</li>
            <li>1 bunch of cilantro chopped very finely</li>
            <li>Salt pepper and oil (sunflower or light olive oil)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak the onion slices in salt water for about 10 minutes, rinse well and drain.</li>
            <li>Mix all the ingredients together in large bowl and let it sit in the fridge for 1 to 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Serve with chifles (fried green banana or green plantain chips) or patacones (thick fried green plantains).</li>
        </ol>
